// APIs
// POSTMAN

// all the logic for node packages is stored in node_modules

// (READ) get request -> it's used to send info from server to browser
// by default fetch is 'GET'
// (DELETE) delete request -> it means browser is requesting to delete something from
// the server's data
// (CREATE) post request -> send data to server from browser
// (UPDATE) put request -> used to update existing data

// let's suppose you want to send info from browser to
// server, you will have to make form in UI
